    "\n",
    "HPS is supported by GeoSMART to develop tutorials for machine learning research in seismology. The aim of this chapter is to develop ML models for seismological use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please contribute the following way:\n",
    "* Provide comments to the current tutorials using GitHub issues on HPS-book.\n",
    "* Contribute of your own tutorial. Under this chapter, we aim to collect tutorials that are method-focused and geared toward training model. For deploying ML for seismology, please contribute in the previous chapters.\n",
    "* You may choose to contribut with your own JupyterBook.\n",
