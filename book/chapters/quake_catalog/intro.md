# Quake Catalog Building

Earthquake catalog building is a rapidly evolving field that blends conventional-precision methods with AI-tools. SCOPED promotes the diversity of catalog buildings tools with the following themes:
* The **Lamont** group is developing a complete set of tools that combines supervised (*phasenet*, *gamma*) and unsupervised (*specufex*) tools using **TensorFlow**.
* The **SeisBench** team, led by Jannes Munchmeyer is building a cloud-native workflow that leverages **SeisBench** (in **PyTorch**) for phase picking and **PyOcto** for phase association.
  The workflow is parallelised and runs on AWS batch.
