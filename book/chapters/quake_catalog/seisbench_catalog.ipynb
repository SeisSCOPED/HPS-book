    "## 0. Background on earthquake catalog generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting into the actual tutorial, let's take a few lines to describe the workflow and the tools we are using. Earthquake catalog generation is typically a two-step process. First, a phase picker identifies a set of (potential) phase arrival times in a set of continuous waveforms. Second, these phases are passed to a phase associator that groups the phase arrivals into events by identifying which picks fit to a consistent origin. This step also helps identifying false picks, as these will usually not correspond to consistent onsets. \n",
    "\n",
    "For phase detection and picking, we use the models integrated in [SeisBench](https://github.com/seisbench/seisbench). SeisBench is a toolbox for machine learning in seismology, offering a wide selection of data sets, models, and training pipelines. In particular, it contains a collection of pretrained phase picking models, i.e., ready-to-use versions of, e.g., EQTransformer or PhaseNet trained on different datasets. In this tutorial, we will be using PhaseNet trained on the INSTANCE dataset, a large, well-curated dataset from Italy.\n",
    "\n",
    " For phase association, we will be using [PyOcto](https://github.com/yetinam/pyocto). PyOcto is a high-throughput seismic phase associator. It was built specifically to deal with the high number of phase picks coming from modern deep learning pickers in dense seismic sequences. PyOcto internally uses an iterative 4D search scheme in space-time.\n",
    " \n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll treat the phase picker and phase associator mostly as a black box. We will interact with it through a prebuilt Docker container. We use this abstraction to focus on the AWS Batch aspects of the workflow, rather than the seismological aspects. If you're interested in the inner workings of the code, the Dockerfile and all codes used in this example are available in the [Cloudwork repository](https://github.com/SeisSCOPED/cloudwork/)."

    "You've now learned the basics on how to use batch processing to create a deep learning based machine learning catalog in the cloud within a few minutes. Clearly, this tutorial is rather simplified, so here are further points you might want to consider when building a catalog:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The picking and association tools have lots of tuning parameters and options, like thresholds or quality control criteria. Here we just hard-coded a set suitable for this tutorial. But why not add a few more parameters to the job definition?\n",
    "- We used a precompiled Docker container. While this is convenient, it also limits your flexibility to configure the behaviour of the tools. To exchange the docker container, you need to push your own container to a registry and edit the job definitions.\n",
    "- Practical earthquake detection workflows are often much more complex than the simplified version we provided. You might want to use a tool to estimate better locations, determine magnitudes, or otherwise characterise your seismicity in more detail. All of these steps can be executed on the cloud and within AWS Batch. However, the simplistic model of managing jobs and their dependencies we used here, will soon reach its limits. To solve this issue, there are workflow management systems like [dask](https://www.dask.org/) or [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) that help you manage such workloads and can operate on top of AWS Batch.\n"
