# SCEC High Performance Earthquake Science Tools
Welcome to our series of tutorials where we will explore four of the main high-performance tools that the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) uses at the frontier of earthquake sciences. These tools are instrumental in helping us understand, predict, and prepare for earthquakes, ultimately aiming to reduce earthquake risk and improve our resilience.

* **Earthquake Forecast using CSEP (Collaboratory for the Study of Earthquake Predictability)**: This tutorial will guide you through the process of earthquake forecasting using the CSEP. We will cover how to use this tool to generate and test earthquake forecast models, providing a comprehensive understanding of the probabilities and potential impacts of future seismic events.

* **Broadband Ground Motion Simulations**: The third tutorial will focus on broadband ground motion simulations. We will explore how these simulations are used to predict the ground motion during an earthquake. This knowledge is crucial for designing earthquake-resistant structures and improving our preparedness for these natural disasters.
