# SCEC HPS Workshop (2023)


In 2023, we ran a virtual workshop May 9-12, 2023 to be our first event, funded by the Southern California Earthquake Center and supported by eScience. We had about 35-80 participants at any time and had an ambitious plan on high performance computing, wavefield simulation, cloud computing, machine learning, and distributed acoustic sensing.
