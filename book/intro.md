ðŸ“– On this JupyterBook website, you will find resources for high-performance computing tailored to seismological research. In particular, we talk about two types of large-scale seismological research:
* Wavefield and earthquake simulations
* Big Data Mining

Both leverage two computing architectures: HPC and Cloud. This book provides training for best practices in computing andf software environment.
